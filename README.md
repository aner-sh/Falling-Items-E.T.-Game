## 🎨 Pixelated Design

Every visual in this game was handcrafted in a **retro pixel art style** to capture the charm of early 80s games. The background, E.T. sprite, power-ups, and even the evil items falling from the sky were designed to feel like they belong on a vintage arcade screen.

## 🧩 Gameplay Overview

The goal is simple: **catch helpful items, avoid harmful ones, and level up your XP bar to reach 3000**. Sounds easy? Think again — not everything falling from the sky is your friend...

## 🧪 XP Bar

Your current progress is shown in the **XP bar** at the top of the screen:

- Catching **good items** increases your XP.
- Catching **evil items** will set you back!
- Reach **3000 XP** to win the game.

XP progress is visually tracked with a sleek rocket that travels along the XP bar.
